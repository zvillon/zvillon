# Hello, I'm Zhang Villon! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a College student at Epitech pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have a keen interest in software development and love diving into new technologies and frameworks. My programming journey started C and C++, and I'm constantly seeking opportunities to apply what I learn in class to real-world projects. I'm willing to start working on open sources project and maybe start participating in some hackathons. When not coding, I enjoy exploring the latest tech innovations and collaborating with fellow students on exciting new ideas.
